In most of the distributed systems, the number of open files requirement is huge size.
But in Linux, the default no of open files are 1024.
To incease the no of open files, follow the below steps:

login as root user:
1. Per-User Limit
  Open file: /etc/security/limits.conf
  Paste add the following towards end:
    *         hard    nofile      500000
    *         soft    nofile      500000
    <username>      hard    nofile      500000
    <username>      soft    nofile      500000
  
    Just replace <username> by linux username you wish to add limits for
  
    After this change logout/reboot and login back
  
 2. pam-limits
    Open /etc/pam.d/common-session
    Add following line:

    session required pam_limits.so
    
 3. System-Wide Limit
    Open /etc/sysctl.conf 
    Add following:

    fs.file-max = 2097152
    
 4. Run:

    sysctl -p
 
5. Verify New Limits

    Use following command to see max limit of file descriptors:
    cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
    
    Hard Limit
    ulimit -Hn
    
    Soft Limit
    ulimit -Sn
    
6. Check limit for other user
    Just replace <username> by linux username you wish to check limits for:

    su - <username> -c 'ulimit -aHS' -s '/bin/bash'
    
7. Check limits of a running process:

    Get the pid of process
    ps aux | grep process-name
    
    Suppose, 1234 is PID, then run following commands to check limits:

    cat /proc/1234/limits
    lsof -p 1234
